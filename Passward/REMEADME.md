  Here I designed a simple app for save some important passwords maybe hard to remeber.
  Everyone can copy this to python or make it an aplication.
  
  By running mainfun.py to getin login window, for convenience I seted default password and Admin '1' and '1' which you 
can change in mainlog.py by changing (UD and PD).

  At main window firstly you should input where you use the password and after that input your username and password(twice)
push 'save'(notice only click once) to save that and if you wanna to change the password you can deal with that as same as 
save but at last push 'change' replace 'save'.Pushing 'view' to view the items you have already saved and finally the most
important steps is to input the item you wanna to check and push 'yes' or 'clear' to view it or make textBrowser clean.

  Because I'm a beginner,there are maybe a lot of design flaws in this app. So hope anyone can puts forward correction for
me and I will update it later
